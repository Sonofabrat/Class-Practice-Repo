***Project Proposal***

- Working title: *A replication of Juffs (in press) with Python*

- Project Outline:
  The English Language Institute (ELI) at the University of Pittsburgh accumulated a large amount of written and spoken data. I have been working on this project for some time and analyzing texts by hand. Of course, this is a time consuming task and prone to errors. For this project, I will try and replicate a paper that is in press based on these written data.

**database**  
The data to be analyzed consist of text files in MS word that need to be converted to .txt files to be read by Python.
The data in the dataset has already been cleaned up to a certain extent. However, work remains.
  - breaking the files down into individual assignment files.
  - adding the texts to a student dataframe as we did for the ETS data, along with proficiency and L1 information.

**Analysis**

_*Goal*_  
The goal of the project is for Juffs to learn more Python, to confirm analysis by hand and to lay the ground work for deeper analysis of these texts. Ultimately, the goals is to provide the ELI with advice on curriculum and instructin innovations to benefit students.

_*Linguistic analysis*_  
The analysis will involve measurig lexical diversity 'D', lexical sophistication through comparison with BNC-COCA frequency tables, and to examine whether errors in usage are detectable.

_*Hypotheses*_  
Based on the original paper, I anticipate that the data will not show L1 differences, that D will not show differences from level 4 to level 5 and but that measures of lexical sophistication will show differences from one level to the next.
