# 1. Comparing English Dialects
 - I think it would be interesting to look into different dialects of English. Some examples of things I could do would be to compare the most common words in the dialects, compare those with the top most common English words, and create scripts that could make sentences in those dialects (like bible speak from computational lingustics).
 - To do this, I could delve into the Leipzig Corpus: http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download/ 
 - I looked into the English corpora and found datasets of comparable size and year in countries whose first languages (I believe) would mostly be English; Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and United Kingdom. 
 - I would like to specifically compare Canada with either Australian or United Kingdom English.


## Canada vs. Australia/United Kingdom

Working title.
A brief summary.
The DATA portion. Example points you should address: What will your data look like? What sorts of data sourcing and cleaning up effort will be involved? Do you have a sense of the overall data size you should be aiming for? Do you have an existing data source in mind that you can start with, and if so, what are the URLs or references?
The ANALYSIS portion. Example points you should address: What is your end goal? What linguistic analysis do you have in mind? Any hypothesis you will be testing? Are you planning to do any predictive analysis (machine learning, classification, etc.), and using what methods?
The PRESENTATION portion. I don't expect a whole lot of variability on this, but describe anything noteworthy you have in mind.
