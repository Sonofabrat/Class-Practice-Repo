### First Proposal

Collect comments from news sites with different political biases: right(fox news), alt-right(breitbart, drudge report),
liberal(Huffington Post, MSNBC) and impartial(AP, Reuters).  Attempt to find data points that
will allow me to develop an algorithm that is able to detect from which site (or bias)
future comments came from.  Then, use machine learning algorithms to find trends in data to make algorithm better.
